# React - The Complete Guide ~ The Expense Tracker
This is a project created in following the fantastic [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) udemy course, by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. I'll be updating the project while the course touches on it.

Once it's done, I'll try to personalize it to the best of my abilities as to show my progress, trackable via the commit history of the repository.

To see my overall skills and studies, you can go to my [Learning Tracker](https://github.com/WalkerMillgress/WalkersLearningTracker).
